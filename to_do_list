1.      Login page [DONE]
1.1     Login credentials verification [DONE]


2.      Registration page [DONE]
2.1     Registration existing user check and verification [DONE]
2.2     Have to add more form validation e.g. for email


3.      CSS for homePage.php and design (what to display in home page? current idea is featured foods which is highlighted in 3.1)
3.1     Admin function to show / remove featured foods (just a proposal) (link to page already created)
        --thinking probably our home page will just be a cover photo at the top, then one row to display several featured foods
        the featured foods can be edited and changed by admin. We can limit the max number of featured foods to show (like maybe 5)


4.      Page for the 3 food categories [DONE]

5.      Page to add new food into menu [DONE]
5.1     CSS for addFoodPage
5.2     Need function to modify food attributes e.g. name/price/availability (in this function, after amending, need to remove the food from cart table if it is set to unavailable) [DONE]


6.      Cart page [DONE]
6.1     [COMPULSORY] JavaScript for 'modify cart quantity function' - the idea is to not want any submit button to update the table, we will add a 'number type input' and run a php/javascript to update the table if user clicked on the button AND hovered away from the input [DONE]

8.      Order Page (a page for user to review all their orders) [DONE]

10.      Admin function to change food order status [REMOVED]
        --Removed from ERD also


11.      Page to amend user's profile information (this is part of the requirement) [DONE]

11.1     CSS for updateProfilePage.php

FINAL CHECKS TO DO BEFORE SUBMISSION

1. Match ERD with SQL database
2. Ensure all form verifications are in place (check the validation logic)
3. Check if Food deleted from Table, what bugs will appear
